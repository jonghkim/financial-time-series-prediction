# [STUDYPIE] Predicting Financial Time Series using Deep Learning

This is a repository for the [[STUDYPIE] Predicting Financial Time Series using Deep Learning](https://studypie.co/course/machine-learning/price_predict/)

## Introduction
- Instructor: [Jongho Kim](https://jonghkim.github.io/), Quantitative Researcher at NICE Pricing and Information (quantic.jh@gmail.com)
- This session DOES NOT aim to learn automatic trading systems, rather DOES focus on stock / coin price prediction based on deep learning, pursuing the most essential algorithms
- This session is an intermediate level course for those who have basic knowledge (Python, Numpy, Pandas, pip) of Python and machine learning

## Goal of this study
- Understand the problems with financial time series predictions and advantages/disadvantages of machine learning 
- Learn how to implement FNN, CNN, RNN models using Tensorflow Keras API on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) 
- Learn which metrics could be important for robustness of time series prediction algorithms 
- Learn how to implement your own neural network models with cryptocurrency data which includes bid/ask volumes, minute level prices and trading volumes 

## Modules
- This session is desinged with four modules:
    - Module 1. [Getting Started + Google Colab Setting](Module1/)
    - Module 2. [Learning Tensorflow Keras API](Module2/)
    - Module 3. [Implementing Time Series Prediction Models](Module3/)
    - Module 4. [Implementing Time Series Prediction Models (More Comprehensive)](Module4/)

## Datasets
- This session use three datasets:
    - Dogs vs Cats dataset from Microsoft [[Download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Dje13qjGZwtaVhhjp-ZJVzeyzJrG6oc1)] (For simplicity, we only use 300 images for each animal)
    - Public dataset: Prices of multiple crypotocurrecies from pythonprogramming.net [[Download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1thjGhgnAm5k1zuSiWhGmlUJzBXM3IECi)]
    - Self Crawled dataset: Prices and orderbook data of multiple crypotocurrecies from CoinOne [[Downloadable on Request](mailto:quantic.jh@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20CoinOne%20Data%20Requests)] 

## Q&A
- [General Machine Learning Questions](Q&A/General_Question.md)
- Module1. [Getting Started + Google Colab Setting](Q&A/Module1.md)
- Module2. [Learning Tensorflow Keras API](Q&A/Module2.md)
- Module3. [Implementing Time Series Prediction Models](Q&A/Module3.md)
